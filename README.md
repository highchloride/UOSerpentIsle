This is a fork of [ServUO](https://github.com/ServUO/ServUO) for UO Serpent Isle.

## UO Serpent Isle

A freeshard for Ultima Online with a map of the Serpent Isle from Ultima 7 part 2 replacing the Ilshenar facet. More details regarding this project can be found at our website: http://www.uoserpentisle.com

### Customizations

There are two folders where the majority of the custom scripts can be found. 

Scripts/Custom holds plug-and-play scripts I've dropped in from other sources. These run with few changes for compatability or personalization to the shard.

Scripts/SerpentIsle holds both fully-custom scripts and plug-and-play scripts that needed extensive modification to compile. 

### Progress/Roadmap

#### 1. Remake the 1993 Serpent Isle map in Ultima Online.
  
  -All terrain has been rescaled and converted to Ultima Online, occupying a large portion of the Ilshenar facet. This includes the highway. A detail pass was done to cleanup some generation errors and shorelines.
  
  -Dungeons such as the Dreamlands and the Dark Path have been converted as well.
  
  -A lore-friendly starting camp and character creation sequence have been constructed, located to the northeast of Vesper.
  
  -Overland passages have been added to mountain ranges where such geography was impossible in the '93 game. This does not interfere with existing undermountain geography.
  
  -Monitor, Fawn, Moonshade, Monk Isle and Sleeping Bull are entirely mapped out.
  
  -Castle of the White Dragon is entirely mapped out and Castle Shamino is underway.
  
  -Undercities such as Spinebreaker, Skullcrusher, and Furnace are mapped and awaiting details.
  
  -Dungeons such as the Mountains of Freedom, the Knight's Test, ice caves and the Goblin Tunnels.
  
  -Minor locations on the map, such as Erstam's Isle, the portal beside Gorlab, etc.
  
  -The Gorlab Swamp is mapped and players will find themselves in the Land of Dreams if they lack key items.
  
  -Sunrise Isle.
  
  -Final detail pass for cleanup/shorelines.
    
#### 2. Add functionality and NPCs.
  
  -Add NPCs to each of the cities. Vendors are already available.
  
  -Add fauna, goblins, etc to overland map. This is roughly 50% complete.
 
#### 3. Testing and Balancing

#### 4. General Beta

#### 5. Release

Much of steps 1 and 2 are already completed, and the server is currently open to the public.

### Screenshots

There are screenshots available in the Discord, as well as at the main page of UOSerpentisle.com.

### Toolkit

UO terrain generation is done with an old copy of Photoshop and MapGenerator2.

Major building construction and terrain editing is done with Centred+.

C# programming is done with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 - 2019.

Additionally using Notepad++, Explorer++, Console2, UOFiddler, and Exult.
